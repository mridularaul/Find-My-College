# MHT CET College Recommendation System

## Overview

We created a college recommendation system using machine learning to help students predict acceptance chances and cutoff scores for various colleges. This system provides accurate forecasts and personalized suggestions to empower students in making informed decisions.

## Features

- **Accurate Forecasts**: Utilizes machine learning to predict current year’s cutoff based on the last 5 years’ cutoffs.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests colleges based on student percentiles and preferences, suggesting the top ranked colleges.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed using Flutter for an intuitive and smooth user experience.
- **Custom Filtering**: Allows students to filter colleges based on their specific criteria.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Built with Flutter for a seamless and responsive user experience.
- **Backend**: Firebase for efficient data handling and real-time updates.
- **Machine Learning**: Leveraged the Random Forest algorithm to predict cutoff scores using a dummy dataset for past year percentiles.
- **Data**: Created a dummy dataset due to lack of proper data, ensuring meaningful predictions and recommendations.
